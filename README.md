# piWarmer

This is a Python scipt that controls an AC/DC relay attached to a Raspberry Pi with a space heater plugged in. There is an adafruit GSM Board that receives text messages using a Ting SIM card connected to the Raspberry Pi. When the Pi receives a text messgae it will turn the AC/DC relay on or off accordingly, thus powering the heater on or off. The following are a list of commands that can be sent to the Pi that will control the heater:

## Acknowledgements

This version was based on [https://github.com/mdegrazia/piWarmer](https://github.com/mdegrazia/piWarmer)

I want to extend my many thanks to Maria for starting such an amazing project

## Disclaimer

****piWarmer is to be used at your own risk****
This version of the code has been modified to increase the reliability and safety of the device, but it is an experimental device.

## Commands

The commands are not case sensitive.

SMS Message | Action
------------ | -------------
ON | Turn the Relay/Heater on
OFF | Turn the Relay/Heater off
STATUS | Return status of the Relay/Heater (on or off)
HELP | Return the list of piWarmer commands.
SHUTDOWN | Shutdown the Pi

## Setup

You will need to modify the piWarmer.config file to match your installation.
This file includes a list of phone numbers that are authorized to issue commands.
The file also includes a phone number that any alerts will be sent to.

## Wiring

__Note__: GPIO25 is physical pin 22

### Relay
- Red wire from GPIO25 to Relay "+"
- Black wire from Relay "-" to GPIO GND

### Fona

### Fona Serial/Modem Communication
- TTL Black to Fona "GND"
- TTL White to Fona "TX"
- TTL Green to Fona "RX"
- TTL Red to Fona "Vio"
- USB to Pi USB

### Fona Status
- ORANGE Fona PS to GPIO23

- GREEN Fona RI to GPIO24

__Note__:GPIO23 is physical pin 16
__Note__:GPIO24 is physical pin 18

### MQ2 Gas Sensor / ADC

#### ADC
- Red F/M: VCC to GPIO 3V3
- Black ADC GND to GPIO GND
- White ADC SDA to GPIO SDAI
- Gray ADC SCL to GPIO SCLI
- White F/F ADC AIN0 to MQ2 White

#### MQ2
- Pigtail Connector into reciever
- Red to GPIO 3V3
- Black to GPIO GND
- Brown to GPIO 12


### Temp Sensor
- White plug into Temp Sensor
- Yellow to GPIO04
- Red to +5VO
- Black to GPIO GND

## Additional Links And Setup Notes

** The MQ-2 needs to be installed with an analog-to-digital converter **
You need to enable I2C using `raspi-config`
You need to modprobe two modules for the temperature sensor to work `w1-gpio` and `w1-therm`

## Materials List

All the parts listed are from Amazon

### Absolutely Required

This assumes you are building "from scratch" and need to buy a Raspberry Pi and associate parts.
I have picked a version of the Pi Zero that has Wireless, which is good if you want to pull the code down directly onto the Pi

Any version of the Raspberry Pi should work for this project as long as it has GPIO pins, and an I2C bus.

The LiPo battery is absolutely required and used directly by the GSM board.

A MicroUSB to USB adapter is required for the modem to connect into the Pi Zero's **__only__** USB port.

### Adapters

The Raspberry Pi zero uses a mini HDMI port for display. If you do not have an adapter, you will need one. This is not required in the installation once the device is "deployed".
The USB hub makes coding and debugging on the PI possible as it allows a keyboard, mouse, and the Fona modem to be connected simultanously. When the piWarmer is "deployed" only the Fona will be plugged into the USB port.
